Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and is an antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV.

Its major metabolizing enzyme is CYP2B6, but also CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2 and CYP2A6  play a role ([Ward 2003](# 5 References), [Ogburn 2010](# 5 References)). CYP2B6 polymorphism is a major determinant of clinical efavirenz disposition and dose adjustment. Efavirenz activates the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and induces its target gene expression. As a consequence, some cytochrome P450 genes are upregulated, and, e.g. higher CYP3A4  ([Shou 2008](# 5 References)) and CYP2B6 ([Ke 2016](# 5 References)) activity levels can be measured.

It has a long half-life, ranging from 52 to 76 hours following single oral doses, and 40 to 55 hours following long term administration as a result of auto-induction of efavirenz metabolism. The long plasma half-life allows for once daily administration with long term administration of a single 600mg daily dose ([Smith 2001](# 5 References)). 

The presented efavirenz model was established using clinical PK data of 7 publications covering  a dosing range from 200 to 600 mg after single and multiple oral administration.  

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for efavirenz in (healthy) adults. The established efavirenz PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/.../Compound-model).
