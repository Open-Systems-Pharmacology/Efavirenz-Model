Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and is an antiretroviral drug to treat HIV.

Its major metabolizing enzyme is CYP2B6, but CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 also play a role ([Ward 2003](#5-References), [Ogburn 2010](#5-References)). CYP2B6 polymorphism is a major determinant of clinical efavirenz disposition and dose adjustment. Efavirenz activates the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and induces its target gene expression. As a consequence, some cytochrome P450 genes are upregulated, and, e.g. higher CYP3A4  ([Shou 2008](#5-References)) and CYP2B6 ([Ke 2016](#5-References)) activity levels can be measured.

It has a long half-life ranging from 52 to 76 hours following single oral doses and 40 to 55 hours following long term administration as a result of auto-induction of efavirenz metabolism. The long plasma half-life allows for once daily administration with long term administration of a single 600 mg daily dose ([Smith 2001](#5-References)). 

The presented efavirenz model was established using clinical PK data of 7 publications covering a dose range from 200 to 600 mg after single and multiple oral administration.
