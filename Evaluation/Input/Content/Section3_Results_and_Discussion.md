The PBPK model for efavirenz was developed and evaluated using publically available, clinical pharmacokinetic data from studies listed in [Section 2.2.2](#2.2 2 Clinical Data).

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#3.1 Final Input Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#3.2 3.2 Diagnostics Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#3.3 Concentration-Time Profiles).
